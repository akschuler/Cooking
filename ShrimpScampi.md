## Ingredients
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
4 garlic cloves, minced
½ cup dry white wine or broth
¾ teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste
⅛ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste
Freshly ground black pepper
1 ¾ pounds large or extra-large shrimp, shelled
⅓ cup chopped parsley (optional)
Juice of half a lemon (fresh/bottled)
Cooked pasta, Rice, or crusty bread to server on top

## Method

In a large skillet, melt butter with olive oil and add garlic; sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute. 

Add wine or broth, salt, red pepper flakes and plenty of black pepper and bring to a simmer. Let wine reduce by half, about 2 minutes.

Add shrimp and sauté until they just turn pink, 2 to 4 minutes depending upon their size. 

Stir in the parsley and lemon juice and serve over pasta, or rice, or accompanied by crusty bread.
